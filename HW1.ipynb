    "## Question 2 :The first set of slides mention demand forecasting. For this, suppose you are working with “demand planners” to create demand forecasts for a set of 100 products. They products are small, tangible goods\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. What is a demand planner?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A demand planner is a professional who forecasts future product or service demand by analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and other business inputs to optimize inventory and align supply with customer needs. Demand planners are critical to a company's success by ensuring that the supply chain can efficiently meet customer demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Why would a demand planner need product forecasts?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A demand planner would need product forecasts to predict future sales, enabling them to optimize inventory, align supply with demand, streamline production and logistics, and avoid stockouts and overstocking. Product forecasts are important to ensure products are available when needed and avoids excess product.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Based on searching, what is the time frequency most likely needed for these forecasts?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demand planners typically work with multiple forecast frequencies at once. These forecats include the following.\n",
    "* **Short-term Forecasts:** Focuses on predicting demand for a short period, typically a few weeks or months for immediate operational decisions.\n",
    "* **Medium-Term Forecasts:** Covers periods of several months to a year, often used for more strategic planning like sales and operations.\n",
    "* **Long-Term Forecasts:** Predicts demand over an extended timeframe, usually one to five years or more.\n",
    "* For 100 small, tangible goods, short-term forecasts would be the time frequency most likely needed. Short-term forecasts would allow for sufficient data aggregation to reduce noise, responsiveness to market/stock changes, alignment with business cycles, and balance between accuracy and operational needs. Weekly forecasting would be the primary frequency, with monthly reviews for longer-term planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### d. What data do you need to get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Historical sales data:** Sales history(last few years), sales by region/channel/customer, orders by timestamp, orders by SKU, pricing/selling information\n",
    "* **Product information:** Attributes(size, category), product launch and discontinuation dates, promos/markdowns(include type, amount off, temporary/perminant\n",
    "* **Promotional Data:** Marketing events, campaign performance, price change effects\n",
    "* **Inventory Data:** Units sold, item counts, shipments, refunds, supplier information \n",
    "* **External Factors:** Holidays, school breaks, weather data, competitor data, market trends\n",
    "\n",
    "### e. You are to meet with a couple of the demand planners. What are some questions you would like to ask them?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What do we want the model to do?\n",
    "* How frequently do you need updated forecasts?\n",
    "* What external factors impact demand for these products?\n",
    "* Questions about how changes in inventory are handled, such as returns.\n",
    "* Questions on what success may look like.\n",
    "* Questions about seasonal factors and holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### f. After building the models, how would you show to the demand planners that the results should be trusted?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Metrics:** Using metrics on historical performance such as forecast accuracy, bias\n",
    "* **Visuals:** Using visuals such as charts and graphs to communicate the results visually.\n",
    "* **Ongoing Monitoring:** Monitoring model performance with ongoing accuracy tracking and reporting\n",
    "* **Confidence Intervals:** Providing uncertainty with predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### g. Describe some characterisitcs of the data that would be needed to produductionize the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Timeliness:** Recent data for forecasting updates, the data should be updated frequently and consistently.\n",
    "* **Consistency:** Data is automated with quality checks, the data is standardized across sources\n",
    "* **Accuracy:** Data is correct, with minimal missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "### h. What is your best guess as to how they would want to receive the model results?\n",
