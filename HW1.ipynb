    "## Question 2 :The first set of slides mention demand forecasting. For this, suppose you are working with “demand planners” to create demand forecasts for a set of 100 products. They products are small, tangible goods\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. What is a demand planner?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A demand planner forecasts future product or service demand by analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and other business inputs to optimize inventory and align supply with customer needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Why would a demand planner need product forecasts?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A demand planner would need product forecasts to predict future sales, enabling them to optimize inventory, align supply with demand, streamline production and logistics, and avoid stockouts and overstocking. \n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Based on searching, what is the time frequency most likely needed for these forecasts?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demand planners typically work with multiple forecast frequencies at once. These forecats include the following.\n",
    "* **Short-term Forecasts:** Focuses on predicting demand for a short period, typically a few weeks or months for immediate operational decisions.\n",
    "* **Medium-Term Forecasts:** Covers periods of several months to a year, often used for more strategic planning like sales and operations.\n",
    "* **Long-Term Forecasts:** Predicts demand over an extended timeframe, usually one to five years or more.\n",
    "* For 100 small, tangible goods, short-term forecasts would be the time frequency most likely needed. Short-term forecasts would allow for sufficient data aggregation to reduce noise, responsiveness to market/stock changes, alignment with business cycles, and balance between accuracy and operational needs. Weekly forecasting would be the primary frequency, with monthly reviews for longer-term planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### d. What data do you need to get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Historical sales data:** Sales history(last few years), sales by region/channel/customer, orders by timestamp, orders by SKU, pricing/selling information\n",
    "* **Product information:** Attributes(size, category), product launch and discontinuation dates, promos/markdowns(include type, amount off, temporary/perminant\n",
    "* **Promotional Data:** Marketing events, campaign performance, price change effects\n",
    "* **Inventory Data:** Units sold, item counts, shipments, refunds, supplier information \n",
    "* **External Factors:** Holidays, school breaks, weather data, competitor data, market trends\n",
    "\n",
    "### e. You are to meet with a couple of the demand planners. What are some questions you would like to ask them?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What do we want the model to do?\n",
    "* How frequently do you need updated forecasts?\n",
    "* What external factors impact demand for these products?\n",
    "\n",
    "### f. After building the models, how would you show to the demand planners that the results should be trusted?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ongoing Monitoring:** Monitoring model performance with ongoing accuracy tracking and reporting\n",
